# Blockchain Sketches
Sketches of wallet integration and other blockchain smart contract functionality.

This repository is basically an elaborate Gist with some example code. Don't expect this code to be suitable for any kind of production environment. It's just a rough reference.

## Run

Install: 
* Node.js
* Yarn
* MetaMask browser extension

After you git clone this repo and cd into it
```
git clone git@github.com:aquabu/blockchain_sketches.git
cd blockchain_sketches

yarn install
node server.js

open http://localhost:8080
```

## Approach

* Quick sketches - not the prettiest code, but clean enough to think about
* Low ceremony examples
* Fairly minimal use of libraries
* No or limited tests except where it helps me think more clearly or illustrates usage
* Remember I said this isn't production code
