# Blockchain Sketches
Sketches of MetaMask and other blockchain wallet integration functionality.

This repository is basically an elaborate Gist with some example code. Don't expect this code to be suitable for any kind of production enviironment. It's just a reference.

## Run

Install: 
* Node.js
* MetaMask

After you git clone this repo and cd into it
```
yarn install
node server.js
```
Visit `localhost:8080`

## Approach

* Quick sketches - not the prettiest code, but clean enough to think about the code
* Low ceremony examples
* Fairly minimal use of libraries
* No or limited tests except where it helps me think more clearly or illustrate usage
* Remember I said this isn't production code
